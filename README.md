# WHYBmaths
This repository is for my YouTube channel WHYBmaths, where I post mathematical physics videos. Here you can find notes that I produced while making the videos, as well as a few notes I wrote whilst doing my masters degree!


# Mathematical Physics on YouTube

Here is a link to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9bTwyZMt5HxScZ5f7BT34Q), where I make concise (15 min) mathematical physics lectures (and my dog watches!), covering topics usually ommited on standard physics courses (differential geometry, multilinear algebra, group theory).

I am currently uploading a series of videos covering Special and General relativity from a differential geometric perspective, building on topics previously covered on the channel. 

I regularly receive and answer questions, and really enjoy the discourse with people watching each video!

# MSc Thesis - Einstein-Cartan Gravity

This repository also contains a copy of my [MSc thesis](./MScThesis/Edge_Modes_and_Boundary_Condition_in_Gauge_Theories.pdf)

The thesis worked on an open problem in Einstein-Cartan gravity, that the boundary geometry in standard general relativity is degenerate. The project involved learning the mathematical formalism of gauge theories (principal bundles), before studying the Einstein-Cartan theory; a gauge theoretic approach to general relativity.

The thesis focused on the boundary problem by considering the phenomena of 'edge modes', in spacetimes with a boundary, gauge transformations on the boundary that ensure continuity of gauge fields on the boundary. Working in a 2+1 dimensional deSitter spacetime, I verified solutions to a modified Einstein-Cartan action, that compensate for the degenerate boundary geometry.

I derived constraints that these solutions imply for the edge modes on the boundary, and verified that such constraints are satisfied in the 2+1-dimensional Minkowski and deSitter spacetimes that contain a spacelike boundary hypersurface.
